# js-dev-env-demo-api
API for JS Dev Env Demo in Pluralsight course

'cors' -> enable cross origin calls being that we're calling our Heroku-based API from a different domain than the UI for this app


app.json describes our app to Heroku

Procfile declares the command that Heroku should run

...add in testing, linting, etc....later on after deployment to Heroku
